# Two-Stage-OTA
The repository contains design parameters, schematics, waveforms and hand-written calculations pertaining to the design of a two-stage OTA in Cadence Virtuoso. 
The problem statement was:

Design a Miller-compensated two stage OTA with an open loop gain of at least 40 dB, a gain-bandwidth product of 30MHz, a phase margin of at least 70° and a slew rate of 30V/μs. The OTA must act as a non-inverting amplifier of gain 2 when modelled as a closed-loop system.
